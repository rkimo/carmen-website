    <p id="blurb">testCarmen Marie Alonso is an young Toronto artist. Thematically, she expresses a vibrant visual collision between romanticized nostalgia and apprehensive reverence for the loss of innocence that accompanies adolescence. The dream-like spaces Carmen creates, are imagined as a result of experiences she has had in her own youth, having many notable (and visually impacting) memories in and around the parks and pools of Toronto. Carmen finds influences in both the historic palettes and patterns of artists like Vuillard and Monet, as well as in the contemporary themes and styles of her professors and peers in the Toronto art scene.</p>
